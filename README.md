## My Personal website! 

This repository is used to host my personal site, where you can find general information about projects I am currently working on, my [resume / CV](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JMylCL_yUeGk2OSRNCMHGAYFlDx5MzUK), blog posts, and life updates. 

The base theme of the personal site is [minimal theme](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/), which is available on the github pages. One of the personal pages used as inspiration is the site of [Shuangning Li](https://lsn235711.github.io/index.html). 

If you want to use this same style, you can clone the repository and edit it.
